This approach only works for the variety one type of questions where we only have to tell 
whether there exists a pair of elements in the array which sums up to target or not.

Since we sort the array we cannot really tell the indexes of the orignal array, unless we 
store the orignal array in some other container which makes the appoach not so optimal
