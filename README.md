# DSA-in-CPP
 This is the repository where i practice my cpp as well as my DSA skills

# ----Progress----

# 1. Learning the Basics-

## 1.1 (Basics of cpp)
- Basics of CPP is done, Revised my knowledge of datatypes and datatype modifiers like long short signed
- unsigned etc. Learnt about strings basic, dry run a for loop (remember after initialisation it just makes an inverted triangle like pattern)
- At last I did Call by Value and Call By reference (Just use the & sign in parameters)
- Time and space complexity basics were studied

## 1.3 C++ STL
- Learnt about all the basic reuired STL Algorithms, Containers and Iterators

## 1.4 Basic Mathematical Concepts
- Extraction of digits (Basic Number System)
- Reverse a number
- Palindrome Number
- Armstrong Number
- Find all divisors
- Check Prime
- Find greatest common divisor (Brute Force) -> (Optimal Brute Force) -> (Eucledian Algorithm)

## 1.5 Basic Recursion
- Understood the dry run 
- Printed normally till 1 to N
- printed normally till N to 1
- printed 1 to N using backtracking method
- printed N to 1 using backtracking method
- understood parameterised and functional recursion
- found summation till N using parameterised and functional recursion
- found factorial using functional recursion
- reversed an array using func. recursion
- checked if a string is palindrome or not by functional recursion
- printed nth fibonacci element using both loop and recursion
